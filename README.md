# Network Intrusion Detection System using various Machine Learning Techniques
 
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a type of software application which cater to the responsibility of detecting violation of policies and other malicious activities by analysis through monitoring a network or some systems. With the pandemic excessively aggravating the usage of Internet and computer systems, the number of attacks is increasing immensely, threats are being created to compromise systems or networks in a rapid manner. The CIA Triad Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, is severely affected as a result of Intrusions. Hence, Intrusion Detection Systems should be adopted to be aware of miscreants and prevent potential attacks. This will help protect important data and services.



In this Project, we aim at developing a Network Intrusion Detection System using various Machine Learning Techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine and Na√Øve Bayes. Analysis of network parameters such as srv_count, flag etc. are accounted for and with the help of such values the prediction is made that an attack is happening or not. All the techniques are taken into consideration and compared
